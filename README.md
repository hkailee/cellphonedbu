# CellPhoneDB Utility Tools (CellPhoneDBu)

## What is CellPhoneDBu?
CellPhoneDB Utility Tools improve input data for CellPhoneDB - a publicly available repository of curated receptors, ligands and its interactions. Subunit architecture is included for both ligands and receptors, representing heteromeric complexes accurately. This is crucial, as cell-cell communication relies on multi-subunit protein complexes that go beyond the binary representation used in most databases and studies.

Please refer to [existing repository] (https://github.com/Teichlab/cellphonedb) on how to use the program. 

Utility tools included to date:

1. Winsorizing the sample data of each cluster at limit of 0.05 (upper only).
